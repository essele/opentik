This is going to become an open version of something similar to the MikroTik RouterOS

It's likely to be based on the OpenWRT builds with a different interface and mechanisms for configuring the system.

It's really early days ... I'm just tinkering at the moment


Update: September 2015

- Reworked to use buildroot as the base build
- Including qemu to enable easy simulation and testing
- Starting on a Lua based system to closely mirror Mikrotik's interface
- So far have basic config system working (no actions yet!)
